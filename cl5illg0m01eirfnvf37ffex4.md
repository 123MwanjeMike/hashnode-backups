## Build a CI/CD pipeline with Heroku CI.

> Heroku CI automatically runs your appâ€™s test suite with every push to your appâ€™s GitHub repository, enabling you to easily review test results before merging or deploying changes to your codebase.

Besides strong Dev/prod parity, using Heroku CI comes with many benefits key of which include;
- Parallel Test Runs.
- Browser tests and User Acceptance Tests
- Seamless integration with Heroku pipelines
- Easy customization of test dependencies in the test environment
- A Simple Integrated Solution (integration, hosting and deployment)
- Simple, prescriptive developer experience in modern CI/CD solutions
- Management support
- Many supported languages

In this article, we shall build a Heroku Flow CI/CD pipeline that utilizes Heroku CI.

### Part 1: App init.
We are going to build a simple node.js application that calculates the factorial of a number. We shall however start with its api and then add the factorial functionality later. This is so we can see Heroku CI in action.
To start, fork the repository [here](https://github.com/123MwanjeMike/cicd-with-herokuci.git) and then clone your forked repository to your computer.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/123MwanjeMike/cicd-with-herokuci.git
```
Next, change to the created directory and switch to the start branch.
```
$ cd cicd-with-herokuci/
$ git checkout start
```
Initialize the project with _npm init_ and then install express
```
$ npm init -y
$ npm install express
```
You should have a new file _package.json_ in your directory. Open it and add the start script _node index.js_.
```
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "start": "node index.js"
},
```
Now create a simple api for the app in _index.js_ file with the code below.
```
$ touch index.js
```
```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Welcome to the Factorial calculator ðŸŽŠ' });
});

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({ message: 'Resource not found.' });
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`));

```
Running _npm start_ should give a similar output as below
![Output after running npm start](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655675963/SbUhXI6dO.png)
![When base url is accessed in browser](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655678082/-o63WiNDP.png)

We now have a basic setup for our application.

### Part 2: The pipeline.

We shall be adding our application to a Heroku pipeline.
First we need to tell Heroku which services to run and how to run these. To do this, we shall add a _Procfile_ file at the root of our directory by running;
```
$ echo "web: node index.js" >> Procfile
```
Commit and push your changes to the remote repository.
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "<enter your message here>"
$ git push origin start
```

Now move [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/new) if you have a Heroku account and create a new Heroku pipeline. Remember to connect your forked repository as you create the pipeline. You should end up with a screen like below.

Click **Enable Review Apps** to have deploy previews for the pull requests(PRs) before they are merged.
![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655681289/sUu_-nYWG.png)
Next, under the staging section of the pipeline, click **Add app** and create a new app. Its common practice to have the staging app deployed from the develop branch and the production app from the main branch.
In this case, my factorial-app is being deployed from my default branch(main).
![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655683309/EtePD76_d.png)
Click settings and scroll to the Heroku CI section. Click Enable Heroku CI.
**Note:** Heroku gives 1000 free dyno hours per month to its verified users and these can be used to access the Heroku CI service for free until they are depleted â€” in which case you start paying per extra dyno minutes used.
![Before enabling Heroku CI](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655685003/-C4G6elKu.png)
Our pipeline is now set up and we are ready for action.

### Part 3: The applicationâ€™s factorials service

We are now going to add a service to our application. We want to enable it calculate the factorial of a number. This will be through a get request with path parameters. We shall use the test driven development approach while at it, so install the test runner mocha and the assertion library chai.
```
$ npm install -D mocha chai
```

Open the _package.json_ file and find the test key under scripts and change its value to have _mocha *.test.js || true_. Your scripts now look like so.
```
"scripts": {
  "test": "mocha *.test.js || true",
  "start": "node index.js"
},
```
We are basically telling mocha to execute _.test.js_ files without displaying errors when we run _npm test_.
Let us now create our test file _factorial.test.js_ that will have our tests which will be automated later on.
```
$ touch factorial.test.js
```
```javascript
const { assert } = require('chai');
const factorial = require('./factorial');

describe('Factorial test', () => {
  it('Factorial(0) = 1', () => {
    assert.equal(factorial(0), 1);
  });

  it('Factorial(1) = 1', () => {
    assert.equal(factorial(1), 1);
  });

  it('Factorial(5) = 120', () => {
    assert.equal(factorial(5), 120);
  });

  it('Factorial(171) = Infinity', () => {
    assert.equal(factorial(171), Infinity);
  });
});
```

Next, create the file _factorial.js_ to which we shall write our function that calculates the factorial of a number.

```
$ touch factorial.js
```
```javascript
const factorial = (number) => {
  let result = 1;
  if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
    return result;
  }
  for (let i = number; i >= 1; i -= 1) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
};

module.exports = factorial;
```
We can run our test suite with _npm test_ and get the output as below
![npm test output](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655688470/UZJr9KHkD.png)
Now let us update our _index.js_ too with an end point that can serve requests for the factorials of numbers.
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const factorial = require('./factorial');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const { host } = req.headers;
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Welcome to the Factorial calculator ðŸŽŠ', docs: `http://${host}/docs` });
});

app.get('/docs', (req, res) => {
  const { host } = req.headers;
  res.status(200).json({
    message: 'Documentation',
    request: `http://${host}/factorial/<number>`,
    response: 'The factorial of <number> is <result>`',
    example: {
      request: `http://${host}/factorial/5`,
      response: 'The factorial of 5 is 120`',
    },
  });
});

app.get('/factorial/:number', (req, res) => {
  const { number } = req.params;
  if (isNaN(number)) return res.status(400).json({ message: `'${req.params.number}' is not a number.` });
  if (number > 200) return res.status(200).json({ message: `The factorial of ${number} is Infinity` });
  return res.status(200).json({ message: `The factorial of ${number} is ${factorial(number)}` });
});

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const { host } = req.headers;
  res.status(404).json({ message: 'Resource not found.', docs: `http://${host}/docs` });
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`));

```
I added a docs endpoint to provide documentation for our service request.

### Part 4: The magic

The moment of truth has come. Now we shall push our changes again to GitHub, open a pull request then observe how it all works.
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Factorial service"
$ git push origin start
```
After opening the pull request, we see that Heroku CI tests passed and that the branch was successfully deployed. We can also go ahead to checkout the deployment.
![Open pull request on GitHub](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655690062/4EdCSUyNo.png)
![Deploy preview for our pull request](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655691773/ceTyHJXBn.png)
![All our tests passed on Heroku CI](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655693387/1D2LTYGLU.png)
![Our Heroku pipeline](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655695119/WG8Cl9kKh.png)
Finally, lets enable automatic deploys for our factorial-app still under the staging section of our pipeline.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655698686/sAk7GVPhM.png)

From now on, any code push to our main branch will automatically be deployed to the staging environment of our application.
![Our changes on main branch deployed to staging](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655700531/TM791R9cy.png)
![Factorial app running](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657655702188/r5IjZvL8B.png)
Since everything is working fine, we can then move/promote the app to production.

## Conclusion

As you have seen, setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Heroku CI is quite easy and Heroku Flow is a very intuitive workflow for visualizing your code delivery process. Heroku is ideal for small and medium business applications even though large business application with a microservices architecture can still leverage it. With Heroku CI, you can move fast without breaking things.

For reference, you can find the entire project code in this [repository](https://github.com/123MwanjeMike/cicd-with-herokuci) with branches start, part-1, part-2, and part-3 that have the resultant code version of each respective part above and the final application code in the main branch.
