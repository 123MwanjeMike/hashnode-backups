# Mono-repos are not an ideal setting for open source contributions

Open sourcing software products more often than not increases the success of these with interested software engineers all over the globe contributing to the rapid development than would be the case with proprietary software products. This has led to many organisations including those with multiple software products, with millions of lines of code, maintained in a mono-repository to open source their codebase in order to benefit from what the open source community has to offer. Whereas mono-repositories can provide a couple of advantages for maintainers in such an organisation, they provide a real push back to external contributors most especially the one time and first time contributors both of which do not benefit from the mono-repository in any way. This is a essence as the success of an open source software project greatly depends on the attitude of the contributors which can be negatively affected by the first time experience. A good solution should be able to maintain the benefits of the mono-repository setup whereas addressing the underlying issues of large repository clone size, break the inter-product dependencies, and remove the bureaucratic processes created by mono-repository. My proposal is to use a combination of tools to achieve this that include the use of git-subtrees and sophisticated automations that require minimal human intervention to move open source contributions through the development lifecycle.
